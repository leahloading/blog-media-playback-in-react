# Building a Podcast App: Media Playback in React

Hi! I'm currently working on a custom podcast application to display and listen to episodes, for my friends over at [It's Not A Book Club Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2ZgTm0yBRe8reSrRKY7uzk).

The ability to manage episode playback within my code is an important part of this.

I've written an article to document part of my process, and the code in this repo should help to explain my thinking.

Thanks,
Leah.
